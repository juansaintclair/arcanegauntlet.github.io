# Arcane Gauntlet

Arcane Gauntlet is a simple but addictive roguelike dungeon crawler where every level is procedurally generated, creating a unique and unpredictable adventure every time you play. Choose your class, delve into the ever-changing depths, and see how long you can survive.

## How to Play

The goal is to descend as deep into the dungeon as you can. Each floor is filled with monsters to fight, items to collect, and a staircase to the next level. The game is turn-based: every action you take (moving, attacking) allows every monster on the level to take an action as well.

### Controls

- **Desktop:**
  - **Movement:** Use the **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** keys.
  - **Melee Attack (Warrior/Guardian):** Move into an adjacent enemy.
  - **Ranged Attack (Mage):** Press **'T' or Spacebar** to automatically fire at the nearest visible enemy.
- **Mobile:**
  - Use the on-screen **D-Pad** for precise, single-step movements.
  - **Tap-to-Move:** Tap any explored tile to automatically walk there. The character will move one step at a time, and the path will be shown on screen.
  - **Tap-to-Interact:** Tap on a monster, item, or door to automatically move to and interact with it (attack, pick up, or open).

## Core Mechanics

### Procedural Generation

Every floor of the dungeon is generated from scratch when you enter it. The layout of rooms and corridors, the placement of monsters, and the location of items are always different. Every 5th floor is a special "Boss Arena" with a powerful guardian.

### Classes

You can choose one of three classes at the start of your run:

- **Warrior:** A master of offense. Starts with higher Attack (5) and lower Defense (2).
- **Guardian:** A stalwart defender. Starts with higher Defense (5) and lower Attack (2).
- **Mage:** A fragile but powerful caster who attacks from a distance. Starts with high Attack (4) and low HP/Defense.

### Legacy System: The Armory

Death is not the end! When you are defeated, you leave behind a legacy in the form of **Soul Shards**. These shards are a permanent currency you can spend in **The Armory** (accessible from the main menu) on powerful, permanent upgrades that apply to all future runs.

- **Ancestral Blade:** Increases starting Attack.
- **Aegis of the Fallen:** Increases starting Defense.
- **Stalwart Heart:** Increases starting Max HP.
- **Endless Vigor:** Increases starting Steps/Energy.

### Relic System

Relics are powerful passive items found during a run. They provide unique bonuses that last only for the duration of that specific run, making each playthrough feel different. Relics are found at rare **Ancient Altars** that have a chance to appear on each floor.

#### Available Relics:

- **ü©∏ Vampiric Fang:** Heals you for 1 HP whenever you deal attack damage.
- **üõ°Ô∏è Thorns Shield:** Deals damage back to attackers based on your Defense.
- **üéì Amulet of Knowledge:** Gain double XP from defeating monsters.
- **üíé Soul Catcher:** Collect 50% more Soul Shards from fallen foes.
- **üíñ Golem Heart:** Regenerates 1 HP every 20 steps you take.
